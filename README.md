## 1/ Structure of the repository

* Notebooks : You can find all the notebooks in this file. For each city, there are the results of the models. The Notebook ```0-Cleaning_datasets.ipynb``` has cleaned the whole "Demande de Valeurs Fonci√®res" dataset to have smaller datasets that we can use. Those datasets have been saved in the file __Data__.

* Data : 

`* Datasets used for the models of estimating housing price (created with ```0-Cleaning_datasets.ipynb``` Notebook).`

`* Public datasets from Insee or metro stations to add external information`

* Helpers : You can find the detailed functions that we used in the Notebooks
